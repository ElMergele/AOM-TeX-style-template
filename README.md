# TeX template for Academy of Management style
This is a TeX template for paper submissions to the Academy of Management (AOM). It adheres to most of the style guidelines detailed [here](http://aom.org/annualmeeting/submission/guidelines/#paperguideline), however it is not currently complete. Updates and fixes are welcome.

Note: the current version was typeset and tested with [XeLaTex](http://www.xelatex.org/), and uses packages such as `fontspec` which require XeTeX or LuaTeX. I believe these are already included with most modern distributions of TeX, so you need only to choose the appropriate option when typesetting.
